			"title": "About",
			"description": "I have always had a passion for creating things. During my studies in computer science, and especially through my major in Human Computer Interaction Design, a great interest in UX arose in me. What I particularly like about this area is the interplay of different disciplines such as design, technology, psychology, communication and so on. That‘s why I decided to pursue a career in this field and I am extremely motivated to help shape the digital future.",

I like to spend my free time doing outdoor sports, such as ski touring, surfing, mountain biking, cycling or hiking. Additionally, I find joy in pursuing creative hobbies such as photography, drawing, illustration, and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. These activities not only provide me with a sense of relaxation but also fuel my creativity and inspire fresh perspectives."
